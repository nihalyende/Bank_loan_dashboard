
Bank Loan Dashboard
This project is a Bank Loan Dashboard built using Power BI, which provides an interactive report for visualizing and analyzing various loan-related metrics. It helps track loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and other relevant details, offering insights into loan performance.

Project Overview
This dashboard visualizes bank loan data, providing insights such as:

Total loan applications
Total funded amounts
Total amount received
Average interest rates
Average debt-to-income ratio (DTI)
Loan details based on various filters like state, grade, and loan status

It is divided into three primary sections:

Summary: A high-level overview of loan applications and funding details with key metrics displayed at the top.

Overview: Monthly loan applications, distribution by state, loan term, and home ownership status.

Details: A detailed view showing individual loan data with adjustable filters for state, grade, and loan status.

Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes various filters that allow users to view loan data by state, loan grade, loan purpose, home ownership status, and more.
Multiple Measures: Users can toggle between different metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, or interest rates.
Visual Insights: Graphs and charts display trends such as loan applications by month, loan term breakdown, and total loan applications by purpose and employment length.
Loan Details: Provides a granular view of individual loans with information like funding amount, interest rate, installments, and amount received.

Filters and Measures
The dashboard supports the following filters and measures:

Select Measure: Allows users to view data based on total loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, etc.
State: Users can filter data by specific states.
Grade: Filters data by the grade assigned to loans (e.g., G1, F5).
Good vs Bad Loans: Segregates loans into good or bad based on predefined conditions.
